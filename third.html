        The challenge associated with front end development is that the tools
        and techniques used to create the front end of a website change
        constantly and so the developer needs to constantly be aware of how the
        field is developing.

      "Hypertext" refers to links that connect web pages to one another, either
      within a single website or between websites. Links are a fundamental
      aspect of the Web. By uploading content to the Internet and linking it to
      pages created by other people, you become an active participant in the
      World Wide Web.
