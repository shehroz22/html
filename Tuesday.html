    <h1>Weather</h1>
    <p>
      Weather is the state of the atmosphere, describing for example the degree
      to which it is hot or cold, wet or dry, calm or stormy, clear or cloudy.
      On Earth, most weather phenomena occur in the lowest layer of the planet's
      atmosphere, the troposphere just below the stratosphere. Weather refers to
      day-to-day temperature, precipitation, and other atmospheric conditions,
      whereas climate is the term for the averaging of atmospheric conditions
      over longer periods of time. When used without qualification, "weather" is
      generally understood to
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weather">
        mean the weather of Earth.</a
