          <em>Diet</em> (alternatively marketed as sugar-free, zero-calorie or
          low-calorie) drinks or light drinks are sugar-free, artificially
          sweetened versions of carbonated beverages with few or no calories.
          They are generally marketed toward
          <strong>health-conscious people, diabetics, athletes </strong> and
          other people who want to lose weight, improve physical fitness, or
          reduce their sugar intake.

          Instead of sugar, artificial sweeteners, such as aspartame,
          cyclamates, saccharin, acesulfame-k, or sucralose, are used to sweeten
          them.<br />Almost every popular sugar-sweetened beverage on the market
          has a “light” or a “diet” version — Diet Coke, Coke Zero, Pepsi Max,
          Sprite Zero, etc. <br />
          Diet sodas were first introduced in the <mark> 1950s </mark> for
          people with diabetes, though they were later marketed to people trying
          to control their weight or reduce their sugar intake. <br />
          Despite being free of sugar and calories, the health effects of diet
          drinks and <del>antificial</del> artificial sweeteners are
          controversial.
