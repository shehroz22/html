          Since <strong>2006</strong>, the Black Series has held a special place at AMG: rare
          automobiles that represent the most direct transfer of motorsport
          technology to <u>road-ready vehicles</u>. <br />
          <br />
          <br />
          The new <em>AMG GT Black Series </em> pushes this tradition to an unprecedented
          level of power and performance. And while the vehicle is indeed
          road-ready, the only place to truly test its capabilities is on a
          <strong>closed track</strong>.
          <br />
          <br />
          <br />
          <h3>1.Engine Capacity</h3>
          For underneath the hood is the most powerful AMG V8 engine,
          methodically configured by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affalterbach" target="_blank">Affalterbach’s engineers</a>   to deliver optimal
          firing at minimal displacement.<br>
           <br> <br> It achieves a staggering <b>720
          horsepower</b> and <b>590 lb-ft</b> of torque, races from <i>0–60 in 3.1 seconds</i>,
          and reaches 124 mph in fewer than  <mark>9 seconds </mark>. <br> <br> <br>
           Based closely on the
          racing program’s GT3, the GT Black Series is as close as you can get
          to the real thrill of the race.
          <br> 
          <br>
          <br>
          <h3>2.Aerodynamics</h3>
          Not only is it the most powerful AMG
          ever, it’s also the most aerodynamic, contains the most intelligent
          mix of materials and boasts the most impressive driving dynamics
          <br />
          <br />
          <br />
          <h3>2.Performance</h3>
          Now, let’s move from performance to design — well, not exactly.
          Because it’s impossible to talk about the <b>sleek appearance </b>of the
          GTBlack Series without discussing performance <br> <br><br> This vehicle has been
          sculpted and refined to achieve the highest output and the <b>purest
          dynamics </b>.<br> <br><br> The wide radiator intake — adapted directly from the GT3 —
          eliminates the need for <b>separate intakes</b> near the wheel wells.
          Semicircular flics and air curtains increase downforce. <br><br><br>The large,
          <strong>carbon-fiber</strong> outlets on the hood likewise help improve downforce and
         <u> high-speed control </u>.<br><br><br> And the rear spoiler can mechanically adjust to
          driving conditions, allowing for an  <strong>optimal balance </strong> between speed and
          stability.
