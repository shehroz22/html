    <h1 style="text-align: center">Samsung Galaxy Note 8 Review</h1>
    <p style="background: rgb(214, 63, 63)">
      The Samsung Galaxy Note 8 is a no-brainer. It takes the Galaxy S8, the
      best phone of the year so far, and adds dual cameras, a better screen, and
      the beloved S Pen stylus. It fills the shoes of the dearly departed Note 7
      elegantly, and is certainly the best phone for creative types

    <h3>Samsung Galaxy Note 8 Review</h3>
    <p class="border_1">
      Depending on your carrier, the Galaxy Note 8 is about $100 more than the
      Galaxy S8+. It's $31.67 per month over 30 months on AT&T ($950), $40 per
      month over 24 months on Sprint ($960), $930 on T-Mobile, or $40 per month
      over 24 months on Verizon ($960). An unlocked model is $929.
    </p>
    <h3>S Pen</h3>
    <p class="border_2">
      Did you come to the Note 8 for the S Pen? You won't be disappointed. The
      pen pops out of a slot in the lower right of the phone, and has a new,
      slimmer 0.7mm tip. As soon as you pop it out, you can start writing on the
      screen, a mode Samsung calls Screen Off Memo. If you run out of screen,
      just slide your text up; it'll make more virtual space to scribble. I
      found the pen to be extremely accurate; when I tapped out a grid of tiny
      dots, it didn't miss one.
