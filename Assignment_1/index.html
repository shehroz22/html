          A soft drink is a drink that usually contains water
          <u>(often carbonated)</u>, a sweetener, and a natural and/or
          artificial flavoring. The sweetener may be a sugar, high-fructose corn
          syrup, fruit juice, a sugar substitute (in the case of diet drinks),
          or some combination of these.<br />
          Soft drinks may also contain caffeine, colorings, preservatives,
          and/or other ingredients.

        &nbsp;

        <p>
          The origins of soft drinks lie in the development of
          <b>fruit-flavored drinks</b>. In the medieval Middle East, a variety
          of fruit-flavored soft drinks were widely drunk, such as sharbat, and
          were often sweetened with ingredients such as sugar, syrup and honey.
          Other common ingredients included
          <em>
            lemon, apple, pomegranate, tamarind, jujube, sumac, musk, mint and
            ice </em
          >. Middle Eastern drinks later became popular in medieval Europe,
          where the word <mark> "syrup"</mark> was derived from Arabic.In Tudor
          England, 'water imperial' was widely drunk; it was a sweetened drink
          with lemon flavor and containing cream of tartar.
          <strong>'Manays Cryste'</strong> was a sweetened cordial flavored with
          rosewater, violets or cinnamon.
