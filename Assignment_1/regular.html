        <h1><u>Regular Drinks</u></h1>
        <pre>Regular soda is generally a mixture
of carbonated water and sweeteners,
like high fructose corn syrup or sucrose;
phosphoric acid, if it’s a dark cola;
<b>“natural flavors”</b> and <b>caffeine</b> </pre>

          <u> Pros and Cons </u>
        </h2>
        <p>
          The <del>important </del> <ins>main</ins> - and perhaps only -
          advantage of drinking regular soda is that it tastes great without the
          strange aftertaste found in diet sodas. <br />
          It is also the preferred soda choice for people who want to avoid
          drinking the artificial sugar substitutes found in diet sodas. Regular
          soda contains <i>a lot of sugar </i> or high fructose corn syrup, both
          of which are high in calories. One can of regular soda averages about
          <mark>150 calories </mark> <br />Now drinking these calories won't
          necessarily make you fat. It takes about 3,500 excess calories to put
          on one pound to your weight, so if you don't drink a lot of soda and
          you eat a pretty good diet otherwise, you shouldn't see any weight
          gain. If you drink a lot of soda, however, you might start running
          into weight problems with all the excess calories adding up.
