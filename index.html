    <h1>Back Workout</h1>
    <div>
      <p>
        Your back is a powerhouse that helps you perform many movements,
        protects your spine, and contributes to your posture. When back muscles
        are weak, it can lead to pain and stiffness. Choosing the proper back
        workouts and incorporating them into your exercise routine can help you
        build a stronger, fitter back.

    <h2>The best back workout</h2>
    <div>
      <p>
        Just as sets and rep ranges are determined by your goals, so are your
        exercise choices <br />
        Back exercises are divided into compound movements, and isolation
        movements. The <strong>compound</strong> exercises activate all heads of
        a muscle, emphasizing a particular head depending on the type of
        movement.
