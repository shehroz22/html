      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>
        Cruise ships are large passenger ships used mainly for vacationing.
        Unlike ocean liners, which are used for transport, they typically embark
        on round-trip voyages to various ports-of-call, where passengers may go
        on tours known as "shore excursions
      </p>
      <pre>
     Modern cruise ships 
     tend to have less hull strength,
      speed, and agility compared to
       ocean liners.However, they
        have added amenities to cater
         to water tourists, with recent vessels being described as balcony-laden floating condominiums</pre

      <p>
        Cruise ships require electrical power, normally provided by diesel
        generators, although an increasing number of new ships are fueled by
        liquified natural has (LNG). When docked, ships must run their
        generators continuously to power on-board facilities <br />
        unless they are capable of using onshore power, where available.
